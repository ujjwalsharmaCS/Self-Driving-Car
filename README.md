# Self-Driving-Car
Implemented a self driving car using deep reinforcement learning with experience replay.

This is a self driving car
The destination of the car are left upward corner and right downward corner. The programs auto updates the destination once the car reached the destination.
There are 2 types of penalties :
  1. When the car is on the sand drawn i.e boundary of the road ( from the sensors )
  2. The distance between the car and the destination i.e living penalty

This project is implemented using python , pytorch and kivy
